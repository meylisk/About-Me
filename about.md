### More Information

My long-time passion for designing methods and ways to improve daily activities around us has finally brought me to the field of Data Science, in which I was interested since my university years.  I am confident that efficient utilization of the everyday data would enhance both the businesses and the services available to public. I believe that my rich engineering background and exposure working with large amounts of technical data, backed by my hands-on       e-commerce sales experience would help me transition constructively into a new field of Data Science.
